This project demonstrates how to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel to classify 
between crocodiles and alligators using simple features such as
snout shape, length, habitat, or other biological indicators.
The plot shows:
Data points colored by class (crocodile or alligator)
The decision boundary (solid line)
The margin (dashed lines)
Support vectors (highlighted points)
